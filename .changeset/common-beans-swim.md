- **Enhanced Randomization Logic**: Achieved 100% modification rate for component exports by fixing a critical randomization bug and adding support for randomizing literal typography values, icon names, and null dimension values.
- **Build Optimization**: Implemented code splitting with `React.lazy()` and configured manual chunks in Vite, reducing the initial bundle size by over 60% (from ~1MB to ~400KB).
- **Documentation**: Updated Component Development Guide with comprehensive guidelines for UIKit.json property values to ensure proper randomization.
