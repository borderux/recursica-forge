# Deploy Workflow
#
# This workflow uses the Changesets Action to manage versioning, releases, and deployments.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Builds the application to ensure it compiles successfully (version mode) or for deployment (publish mode)
# 2. Runs Changesets Action which:
#    - If changesets exist (version mode): Creates a "Version Packages" pull request
#    - If no changesets exist (publish mode): Runs the publish command to create tag and release
# 3. If publish mode (no changesets), builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow runs on every push to main. The Changesets Action handles both modes automatically.

      # Changesets Action - The Core of Our Release System
      #
      # This action has two modes (handled automatically):
      # 1. Version mode (changesets exist): Creates a "Version Packages" pull request
      # 2. Publish mode (no changesets): Runs the `publish` command to create tag and release
      #
      # The `publish` command executes `npm run release` which:
      # - Creates a git tag for the release version
      # - Creates a GitHub release with changelog
      # - Pushes the tag to the repository
      #
      # The action outputs `published` (boolean) indicating if publishing occurred.
      # Note: Since this is a private package, we don't publish to npm.
      # The release script handles git tags and GitHub releases.
