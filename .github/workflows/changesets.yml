# Changesets Workflow
#
# This workflow uses the Changesets Action to manage versioning and releases.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Checks for changeset files - if none exist, exits early (prevents unnecessary runs)
# 2. Builds the application to ensure it compiles successfully
# 3. When changeset files are present, the action creates a "Version Packages" pull request
# 4. When that PR is merged, the action runs the `publish` command (npm run release)
# 5. The release script creates a git tag for the version
# 6. The deploy workflow then builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow runs on every push to main, but exits early if no changesets are found.

      # Changesets Action - The Core of Our Release System
      #
      # This action has two modes:
      # 1. If changesets are present, it creates a "Version Packages" pull request.
      # 2. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged, it runs the `publish` command.
      #
      # The `publish` command executes `npm run release` which:
      # - Creates a git tag for the release version
      # - Pushes the tag to the repository
      #
      # Note: Since this is a private package, we don't publish to npm.
      # The release script only creates git tags for version tracking.
